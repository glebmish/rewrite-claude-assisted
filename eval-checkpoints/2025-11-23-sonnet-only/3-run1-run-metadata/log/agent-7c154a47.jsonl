3.0 migration.\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nI found that OpenRewrite has recipes related to Dropwizard, but they serve different purposes than what you might be looking for:\n\n### What OpenRewrite Currently Offers for Dropwizard:\n\n1. **Migration FROM Dropwizard TO Spring Boot**: Converts Dropwizard Resources to Spring Boot format. This is available through the recipe `org.openrewrite.java.dropwizard.MigrateResourcesToSpringJersey`.\n\n2. **Dropwizard Metrics Migration for Spring Boot 3.x**: Migrate dropWizard dependencies to the new artifactId, since these are changed with Spring Boot 3. This recipe handles package changes like migrating from `com.codahale.metrics.servlet` to `io.dropwizard.metrics.servlet`.\n\n### What About Dropwizard Framework 3.0 Migration?\n\nBased on my search, **there doesn't appear to be a specific OpenRewrite recipe for migrating TO Dropwizard 3.0** from earlier versions.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## OpenRewrite UpgradeDependencyVersion Recipe for Gradle\n\nThe recipe `org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeDependencyVersion` is designed to upgrade the version of a dependency in a build.gradle file.(no content)It supports updating dependency declarations of various forms including string notation (\"group:artifact:version\") and map notation (group: 'group', name: 'artifact', version: 'version'), and can update version numbers which are defined earlier in the same file in variable declarations.\n\n### How to Use It\n\nThis recipe has required configuration parameters, so recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters.\n\n**Example Configuration** (rewrite.yml):\n```yaml\ntype: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe\nname: com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample\ndisplayName: Upgrade Gradle dependency versions example\nrecipeList:\n  - org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeDependencyVersion:\n      groupId: com.fasterxml.jackson*\n      artifactId: jackson-module*\n      newVersion: 29.X\n```\n\n**Gradle Build Setup**:\n```gradle\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.openrewrite.rewrite\") version(\"latest.release\")\n}\n\nrewrite {\n    activeRecipe(\"com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample\")\n    setExportDatatables(true)\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\nThen run: `gradle rewriteRun`\n\n### Alternative: Unified Recipe\n\nThere's also `org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeDependencyVersion` which works for both Gradle and Maven projects - for Gradle projects, it upgrades the version of a dependency in a build.gradle file, and for Maven projects, it upgrades the version of a dependency by specifying a group ID and (optionally) an artifact ID using Node Semver advanced range selectors."],"durationSeconds":16.400261411000013}}

Available Dropwizard recipes are for:\n- Migrating FROM Dropwizard TO Spring Boot\n- Dropwizard Metrics dependency updates for Spring Boot 3.x\n\n### Critical Gap: @Override Annotation Removal\n**Why semantic recipes can't handle this**:\n- `RemoveAnnotation` operates globally on pattern matches\n- No recipe exists for method-name-conditional annotation removal  \n- Requires custom recipe with method signature analysis\n\n**Recommendation**: Manual removal of @Override from `initialize()` and `run()` methods only\n\n### Semantic vs Text Transformation\nAll recommended recipes use OpenRewrite's LST (Lossless Semantic Tree):\n- `ChangeType` - Understands Java type system, updates imports correctly\n- `UpgradeDependencyVersion` - Parses Gradle DSL structure\n- `UpdateJavaCompatibility` - Modifies Gradle toolchain configuration\n\n### Recipe Discovery Process\n1. Searched official OpenRewrite docs and repositories\n2. Checked framework-specific modules (Spring, Dropwizard)\n3. Examined Java migration recipes (Java 17 upgrade path)\n4. Identified semantic recipes for each transformation type\n5. Validated no existing composite Dropwizard 3.0 recipe exists\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation Matrix\n\n| Use Case | Recommended Option |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Want comprehensive Java 17 modernization | Option 1 |\n| Minimal disruption, PR scope only | Option 2 |\n| Future Java 17 feature adoption planned | Option 1 |\n| Conservative migration strategy | Option 2 |\n| Accept manual @Override cleanup | Option 2 |\n| Want automated @Override handling | Neither (requires custom recipe) |\n\nBoth options provide valid approaches with different trade-offs in scope, risk, and completeness."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1916,"cache_read_input_tokens":37680,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1916,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1138,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVQZ55potdg8Ryjq2UDQw","type":"assistant","uuid":"16a354f3-144b-4f0d-a59b-a22f925e0831","timestamp":"2025-11-23T09:05:28.664Z"}
