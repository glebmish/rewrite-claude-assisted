Perfect! Now let me create a final summary for the user:

## Workflow Complete: Rewrite-Assist for PR #3

I have successfully completed the full rewrite-assist workflow for the Java 11 to 17 upgrade PR. Here's a summary:

### Executive Summary

**Analyzed PR:** https://github.com/openrewrite-assist-testing-dataset/weather-monitoring-service/pull/3

**Key Finding:** The PR contains two independent transformation intents:
1. **Java 11→17 upgrade** (infrastructure changes) - **AUTOMATABLE**
2. **Authentication refactoring** (business logic changes) - **NOT AUTOMATABLE**

### Final Recommendation

**Recommended Recipe: Option 2 - Surgical Targeted Approach**
- **Recipe Name:** `com.yourorg.BumpJavaVersionTo17`
- **Approach:** Minimal, infrastructure-only changes matching the PR's automatable subset

### What the Recipe Automates

✓ **build.gradle:** sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility from '11' to '17'
✓ **Gradle wrapper:** Version upgrade from 6.7 to 7.6 (with SHA256 checksum)
✓ **Dockerfile:** Base images from openjdk:11 to eclipse-temurin:17-alpine (JDK and JRE)

### Required Artifacts Generated

All 3 required files have been created in `.scratchpad/2025-11-15-19-29/result/`:

1. **pr.diff** (18 KB) - Original PR changes
2. **recommended-recipe.yaml** (1.1 KB) - Final recipe definition
3. **recommended-recipe.diff** (33 KB) - Recipe execution output

### Validation Results

Both recipe options were validated:

**Option 1 (Comprehensive):**
- Files modified: 7
- Includes: CI updates, Jakarta dependency, full Java 17 features
- Best for: Complete Java 17 migration with modernization

**Option 2 (Surgical)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Files modified: 5
- Scope: Exact match to PR infrastructure changes
- Best for: Minimal risk, infrastructure-only migration

### Coverage Analysis

| Intent | PR Change | Recipe Coverage |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Java version in build.gradle | 11→17 | ✓ PERFECT MATCH |
| Gradle wrapper | 6.7→7.6 | ✓ PERFECT MATCH |
| Dockerfile JDK image | openjdk:11→temurin:17 | ✓ PERFECT MATCH |
| Dockerfile JRE image | openjdk:11→temurin:17 | ✓ PERFECT MATCH |
| Authentication refactoring | Business logic | ⊗ NOT AUTOMATABLE (correctly excluded) |

### Next Steps

The recommended recipe (Option 2) can be deployed immediately for automated Java 11→17 infrastructure upgrades across similar projects. Teams can optionally consider Option 1 for comprehensive migration with language feature adoption.

### Complete Documentation

Detailed analysis, validation results, and both recipe options are available in:
