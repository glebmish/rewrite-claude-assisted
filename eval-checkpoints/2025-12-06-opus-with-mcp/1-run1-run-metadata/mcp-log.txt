[2025-12-06 01:16:31] [MCP] Starting rewrite-assist workflow for PR: https://github.com/openrewrite-assist-testing-dataset/weather-monitoring-service/pull/3
[2025-12-06 01:16:45] [MCP] Session ID captured. Starting Phase 1: Fetch repositories
[2025-12-06 01:17:38] [MCP] Phase 1 completed: Repository cloned, PR branch fetched, diff saved
[2025-12-06 01:17:46] [MCP] Starting Phase 2: Extract transformation intents from PR changes
[2025-12-06 01:18:33] [MCP] Phase 2 completed: Intent extraction complete - identified Java 17 upgrade, Gradle update, Docker migration, and auth refactoring
[2025-12-06 01:18:36] [MCP] Starting Phase 3: Recipe mapping using openrewrite-expert subagent
[2025-12-06 01:19:03] [MCP] Starting Option 1 recipe creation for PR #3 - Java 11 to 17 upgrade with broad approach
[2025-12-06 01:20:36] [MCP] Completed Option 1 recipe creation - Broad approach using UpgradeToJava17 umbrella recipe with Gradle wrapper and Docker image updates
[2025-12-06 01:20:36] [MCP] Option 2 recipe created: Targeted approach with 4 recipes covering Java version upgrade, Gradle wrapper, and Docker images. Coverage ~40% of PR changes (high-confidence items only).
[2025-12-06 01:20:54] [MCP] Phase 3 completed: Two recipe options created - Option 1 (broad/UpgradeToJava17) and Option 2 (narrow/targeted)
[2025-12-06 01:21:18] [MCP] Starting Phase 4: Recipe validation - launching parallel validators for Option 1 and Option 2
[2025-12-06 01:21:42] [MCP] Starting validation of Option 2 recipe (narrow/targeted approach) for PR-3
[2025-12-06 01:21:42] [MCP] Starting validation of Option 1 recipe (broad approach) for weather-monitoring-service PR-3
[2025-12-06 01:22:17] [MCP] Gradle 6.7 incompatible with Java 17 (class file version 61). Trying Java 11 instead.
[2025-12-06 01:24:02] [MCP] Option 2 validation complete. Precision: 90.91%, Recall: 3.39%. Recipe covered build.gradle, Dockerfile, and gradle-wrapper.properties as expected, but missed all Java code changes (file deletions, code refactoring in auth package).
[2025-12-06 01:24:29] [MCP] Option 1 validation complete. Precision: 76.92%, Recall: 3.39%. Recipe covers build/infra changes but not auth refactoring.
[2025-12-06 01:24:40] [MCP] Option 2 validation complete. All output files created: option-2-recipe.diff, option-2-stats.json, option-2-validation-analysis.md
[2025-12-06 01:25:11] [MCP] Phase 4 completed: Option 1 (76.92% precision) vs Option 2 (90.91% precision). Both have 3.39% recall due to auth refactoring not being automatable
[2025-12-06 01:25:14] [MCP] Starting Phase 5: Recipe refinement - combining learnings from Option 1 and Option 2
[2025-12-06 01:27:23] [MCP] Created Option 3 refined recipe combining learnings from Option 1 and Option 2. Key changes: (1) Kept UpdateJavaCompatibility from Option 2, (2) Replaced UpdateGradleWrapper with ChangePropertyValue to avoid SHA256 addition and wrapper binary updates, (3) Kept Docker image replacements unchanged.
[2025-12-06 01:27:54] [MCP] Starting validation of Option 3 recipe for weather-monitoring-service PR-3
[2025-12-06 01:31:10] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete. Precision: 100%, Recall: 3.39%. Recipe covers 3 files (Dockerfile, build.gradle, gradle-wrapper.properties). PR has 11 files with major Java code refactoring not covered.
[2025-12-06 01:31:44] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete. All output files created successfully.
[2025-12-06 01:32:17] [MCP] Phase 5 completed: Option 3 validated with 100% precision (vs 76.92% for Option 1 and 90.91% for Option 2)
[2025-12-06 01:32:21] [MCP] Starting Phase 6: Final decision - selecting Option 3 as recommended recipe (100% precision)
[2025-12-06 01:33:10] [MCP] Workflow completed successfully. All 6 phases finished. Recommended recipe: Option 3 with 100% precision.
