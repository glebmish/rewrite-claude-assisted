[2025-12-06 21:38:52] [MCP] Starting rewrite-assist workflow for PR: https://github.com/openrewrite-assist-testing-dataset/simple-blog-platform/pull/3
[2025-12-06 21:39:10] [MCP] Phase 1: Parsing PR URL and cloning repository
[2025-12-06 21:39:45] [MCP] Phase 1 complete: Repository cloned, PR branch fetched, diff saved. PR changes H2 to PostgreSQL migration.
[2025-12-06 21:39:55] [MCP] Phase 2: Starting intent extraction from PR changes
[2025-12-06 21:40:02] [MCP] Phase 2: Analyzing PR diff to extract transformation intents - H2 to PostgreSQL migration with supporting changes
[2025-12-06 21:40:31] [MCP] Phase 2 complete. Starting Phase 3: Launching openrewrite-expert subagents for recipe mapping
[2025-12-06 21:40:56] [MCP] Starting Option 1 recipe creation for PR #3 - H2 to PostgreSQL migration
[2025-12-06 21:42:38] [MCP] Completed Option 1 recipe creation for PR #3
[2025-12-06 21:42:49] [MCP] Option 2 recipe created: Narrow approach with 14 specific recipes for H2->PostgreSQL migration. Files: option-2-recipe.yaml (3987 bytes), option-2-creation-analysis.diff (2521 bytes)
[2025-12-06 21:43:02] [MCP] Phase 3 complete. Both option recipes created. Starting Phase 4: Recipe validation with parallel subagents
[2025-12-06 21:43:27] [MCP] Phase 4: Launching validator subagents for option-1 and option-2 recipes in parallel
[2025-12-06 21:43:32] [MCP] Starting Option 2 recipe validation against PR #3
[2025-12-06 21:43:32] [MCP] Starting Option 1 recipe validation for PR #3
[2025-12-06 21:45:37] [MCP] Option 2 validation complete - Precision: 78.26%, Recall: 78.26%. Analyzing diff differences.
[2025-12-06 21:45:39] [MCP] Recipe executed successfully. Precision: 76.19%, Recall: 69.57%. Now analyzing gaps and over-applications.
[2025-12-06 21:46:00] [MCP] Option 2 validation complete. All required output files generated.
[2025-12-06 21:46:11] [MCP] Option 1 validation complete. Critical gap: hibernate.dialect not changed. Files saved: option-1-recipe.diff, option-1-stats.json, option-1-validation-analysis.diff
[2025-12-06 21:46:30] [MCP] Phase 4 complete. Option 1: 76.19% precision, 69.57% recall (hibernate.dialect issue). Option 2: 78.26% precision/recall. Starting Phase 5: Refinement
[2025-12-06 21:47:31] [MCP] Option 3 recipe created: Combined learnings from Option 1 (76.19% precision, 69.57% recall) and Option 2 (78.26% precision/recall). Critical fix: hibernate.dialect keyPath changed from $.database.properties.hibernate.dialect to $.database.properties['hibernate.dialect'] to correctly handle YAML keys containing dots.
[2025-12-06 21:47:45] [MCP] Phase 5: Option 3 created with hibernate.dialect fix. Now validating Option 3
[2025-12-06 21:47:51] [MCP] Starting Option 3 recipe validation against PR #3
[2025-12-06 21:48:38] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete. Precision: 78.26%, Recall: 78.26%. Now documenting analysis.
[2025-12-06 21:49:03] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete. All required files generated: option-3-recipe.diff, option-3-stats.json, option-3-validation-analysis.diff
[2025-12-06 21:49:19] [MCP] Phase 5 complete. Option 3 validated: 78.26% precision/recall (matches Option 2, better than Option 1). Starting Phase 6: Final decision
[2025-12-06 21:49:57] [MCP] Workflow complete. All 6 phases successful. Recommended: Option 3 with 78.26% precision/recall. All artifacts generated in .output/2025-12-06-21-38/
