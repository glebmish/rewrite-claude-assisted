## Workflow Complete ✅

### Summary
Successfully analyzed PR #3 (Dropwizard 2→3 migration) and created an OpenRewrite recipe.

### Final Recommendation: Option 3
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Precision | 100% |
| Recall | 100% |
| F1 Score | 100% |

### Key Insight
Options 1 and 2 had a false positive - `RemoveUnnecessaryOverride` incorrectly modified `DatabaseHealthCheck.java`. Option 3 fixed this by adding a precondition that scopes the recipe to `io.dropwizard.Application` subclasses only.
