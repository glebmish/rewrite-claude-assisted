I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm in READ-ONLY mode for file exploration and search tasks.\n\nI understand the key points:\n\n1. **READ-ONLY RESTRICTIONS**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files. No file writing operations of any kind.\n\n2. **File Search**: I can efficiently search codebases using:\n   - Glob for broad file pattern matching\n   - Grep for searching file contents with regex\n   - Read for reading specific files\n   - Bash for read-only operations only\n\n3. **Project Context**: This is a Java 21 Gradle project using OpenRewrite 8.37.1 framework with JUnit 5 for testing.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Use absolute file paths in responses\n   - Make efficient parallel tool calls when possible\n   - Return findings as regular messages without attempting file creation\n   - Adapt search approach based on thoroughness level\n\nI'm currently in the working directory: `/__w/rewrite-claude-assisted/rewrite-claude-assisted`\n\nI'm ready to help you search and analyze this codebase.
