[2025-12-06 13:54:40] [MCP] Starting rewrite-assist workflow for PR: https://github.com/openrewrite-assist-testing-dataset/task-management-api/pull/3
[2025-12-06 13:54:52] [MCP] Session ID saved. Starting Phase 1: Fetch repos
[2025-12-06 13:55:27] [MCP] Phase 1 complete: Repository cloned, PR-3 branch fetched, diff saved (86 lines)
[2025-12-06 13:55:48] [MCP] Analyzed PR diff: Dropwizard 2.1.12 -> 3.0.0 upgrade, Java 11 -> 17, import changes, @Override removals
[2025-12-06 13:56:15] [MCP] Phase 2 complete: Intent tree created with 4 tactical change categories
[2025-12-06 13:56:39] [MCP] Starting Phase 3: Launching OpenRewrite expert subagent for recipe mapping
[2025-12-06 13:58:01] [MCP] Option 2 recipe created: Targeted approach with 12 atomic recipes for Dropwizard 2->3 migration. Files: option-2-recipe.yaml, option-2-creation-analysis.md
[2025-12-06 13:58:04] [MCP] Option 1 recipe created: com.example.PR3Option1 - Composed approach using UpdateJavaCompatibility, UpgradeDependencyVersion (x5), ChangeType (x4), and RemoveUnnecessaryOverride. All intents covered with semantic recipes.
[2025-12-06 13:58:18] [MCP] Phase 3 complete: Both Option 1 and Option 2 recipes created by expert subagents
[2025-12-06 13:58:45] [MCP] Starting Phase 4: Launching validator subagents for Option 1 and Option 2
[2025-12-06 13:58:48] [MCP] Starting Option 2 recipe validation for Dropwizard 2 to 3 migration
[2025-12-06 13:58:49] [MCP] Starting validation of OPTION 1 recipe for Dropwizard 2 to 3 migration
[2025-12-06 14:01:14] [MCP] Completed Option 1 recipe validation: Precision=95.65%, Recall=100%, F1=97.78%. One over-application found in DatabaseHealthCheck.java
[2025-12-06 14:01:17] [MCP] Option 2 validation complete: Precision=95.65%, Recall=100%, F1=97.78%. One false positive: extra @Override removal in DatabaseHealthCheck.java
[2025-12-06 14:01:28] [MCP] Phase 4 complete: Both options validated - 95.65% precision, 100% recall. Same false positive in both.
[2025-12-06 14:02:01] [MCP] Starting Phase 5: Creating refined Option 3 recipe based on learnings
[2025-12-06 14:05:29] [MCP] Created Option 3 recipe with scoped preconditions to fix precision issue. Uses FindImplementations precondition to limit RemoveUnnecessaryOverride to only Application subclasses, preventing false positive on DatabaseHealthCheck.check().
[2025-12-06 14:05:49] [MCP] Option 3 recipe created with scoped preconditions. Launching validator.
[2025-12-06 14:05:52] [MCP] Starting validation of Option 3 recipe for Dropwizard 2 to 3 migration
[2025-12-06 14:06:57] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete - Precision: 100%, Recall: 90.91%. The @Override removal was NOT applied by the scoped recipe. Recipe has 0 false positives but 2 false negatives.
[2025-12-06 14:07:24] [MCP] Option 3 validation complete. Analysis saved to option-3-validation-analysis.md. Key finding: Precondition uses wrong type name (io.dropwizard.core.Application instead of io.dropwizard.Application), causing @Override removal to not execute.
[2025-12-06 14:07:35] [MCP] Option 3 validation: 100% precision but 90.91% recall. Precondition timing issue identified. Creating Option 4 with fix.
[2025-12-06 14:07:53] [MCP] Fixed Option 3 precondition. Re-validating with corrected recipe.
[2025-12-06 14:07:56] [MCP] Starting re-validation of FIXED Option 3 recipe for Dropwizard 2 to 3 migration
[2025-12-06 14:10:09] [MCP] Option 3 re-validation COMPLETE: Perfect match achieved (100% precision, 100% recall). Fix confirmed working.
[2025-12-06 14:10:29] [MCP] Phase 5 complete: Option 3 now has 100% precision and 100% recall - perfect match!
[2025-12-06 14:10:34] [MCP] Starting Phase 6: Creating final artifacts. Recommended recipe: Option 3 (100% precision, 100% recall)
[2025-12-06 14:11:05] [MCP] Workflow complete! All 6 phases finished. Option 3 recommended with 100% precision and recall.
