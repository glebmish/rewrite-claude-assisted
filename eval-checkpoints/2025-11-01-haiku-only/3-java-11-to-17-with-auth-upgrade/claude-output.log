## Workflow Complete ✅

I've successfully completed the `/rewrite-assist` workflow for the weather-monitoring-service Java 17 migration (PR #2). Here's a summary:

### Workflow Execution Summary

**Session ID**: `cc49bb40-f0e3-45c9-8f50-7ce31c7b978d`
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-01 09:03

### Phases Completed

1. **Phase 1 - Repository Setup**: Cloned repository and fetched PR #2 branch
2. **Phase 2 - Intent Extraction**: Analyzed strategic and tactical transformation intents
3. **Phase 3 - Recipe Discovery**: Identified applicable OpenRewrite recipes
4. **Phase 4 - Recipe Validation**: Analyzed coverage gaps and limitations
5. **Phase 5 - Final Recommendations**: Generated artifacts and deployment plan

### Key Findings

**Recipe Coverage: 65-70% Automated**
- ✅ Java version upgrade (11→17) in build.gradle
- ✅ Docker base image updates (openjdk → eclipse-temurin)
- ✅ Removal of deprecated auth filter classes
- ⚠️ Complex authentication refactoring requires manual implementation
- ⚠️ Test updates need developer judgment

### Generated Artifacts

All required files in `.scratchpad/2025-11-01-09-03/result/`:
1. **pr.diff** - Original PR changes (ground truth)
2. **recommended-recipe.yaml** - Final OpenRewrite recipe composition
3. **recommended-recipe.diff** - Expected recipe output on master
4. **recommended-recipe-to-pr.diff** - Gap analysis (recipe vs actual PR)
5. **rewrite-assist-scratchpad.md** - Complete analysis and recommendations

### Recommended Deployment

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Execute the OpenRewrite recipe for automated portions (Java upgrade, class removal, Docker updates)
- Implement remaining 30-35% manually using PR #2 as a reference (UserPrincipal creation, auth configuration, test updates)
- **Estimated total effort**: 2.5-3.25 hours
- **Risk level**: LOW (straightforward version upgrades)

The analysis identified that while OpenRewrite excels at mechanical transformations, Dropwizard-specific authentication pattern modernization requires semantic understanding that current recipes don't provide.
