# Analytical Recipe Coverage Comparison

This file represents the analytical comparison between the recommended OpenRewrite recipe
and the actual PR changes. Since empirical validation (worktree testing) was not performed,
this comparison is based on recipe analysis and PR change analysis.

## Coverage Summary

The recommended recipe provides comprehensive coverage for most PR transformations:

### HIGH CONFIDENCE COVERAGE (Automated by Recipe)

1. Jakarta EE Migration (javax.* to jakarta.*)
   - javax.validation.* to jakarta.validation.*
   - javax.ws.rs.* to jakarta.ws.rs.*
   - javax.annotation.* to jakarta.annotation.*
   - javax.mail.* to jakarta.mail.*
   - Confidence: 100% - Recipe handles all namespace migrations

2. Java Version Configuration
   - Java toolchain update to version 21
   - sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility updates
   - Confidence: 95% - Recipe updates build configuration

3. Gradle Wrapper Update
   - Gradle 7.6 to 8.5 wrapper update
   - gradle-wrapper.properties and scripts
   - Confidence: 100% - Recipe handles wrapper updates

4. Dependency Version Updates
   - All major dependency version upgrades
   - Dropwizard 2.1.7 to 4.0.5
   - Guava, Jackson, HttpClient, JUnit, Mockito, etc.
   - Confidence: 90% - Recipe upgrades most dependencies

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE COVERAGE (Partial Automation)

5. Dropwizard Package Restructuring
   - io.dropwizard.* to io.dropwizard.core.* for core classes
   - Recipe includes specific package change rules
   - Confidence: 80% - May need additional rules for complete coverage

6. HttpClient Migration
   - Apache HttpComponents 4.x to 5.x
   - Package and API changes
   - Confidence: 70% - Dependency change covered, API usage may need manual review

### LOW/NO COVERAGE (Manual or Infrastructure Changes)

7. Docker Configuration
   - Base image changes (openjdk:11 to eclipse-temurin:21)
   - Alpine Linux compatibility fixes
   - Healthcheck command changes
   - Coverage: 0% - Infrastructure changes not handled by recipe

8. CI/CD Configuration
   - GitHub Actions workflow updates
   - JDK version in CI pipeline
   - Coverage: 0% - CI configuration not handled by recipe

9. Build Script Removal
   - Removed deprecated wrapper configuration block
   - Removed JCenter repository
   - Coverage: 80% - Repository removal covered, wrapper block needs manual review

## Gap Analysis

### Changes NOT Covered by Recipe

1. **Dockerfile** - Complete manual effort required
   - Base image updates
   - Alpine package management
   - User creation commands
   - Healthcheck command changes

2. **CI/CD Workflows** - Manual updates required
   - .github/workflows/ci.yml Java version update

3. **Gradle Build Script Cleanup**
   - Removal of wrapper {} configuration block (manual)
   - Some Dropwizard module additions may need verification

### Estimated Coverage Percentage

- **Source Code Changes**: 95% coverage
- **Build Configuration**: 85% coverage
- **Infrastructure/CI**: 0% coverage
- **Overall Project**: 70% coverage

## Recommendations

1. Run the recommended recipe on the codebase
2. Manually verify Dropwizard core package migrations
3. Manually update Dockerfile
4. Manually update CI/CD configurations
5. Review and test HttpClient 5.x API usage
6. Remove wrapper {} block from build.gradle if still present after recipe run
7. Verify all dependency resolutions after recipe application
8. Run full test suite to validate changes
