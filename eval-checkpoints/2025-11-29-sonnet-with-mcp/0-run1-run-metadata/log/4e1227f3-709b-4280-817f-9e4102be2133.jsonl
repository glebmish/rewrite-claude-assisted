You're an experienced software engineer who is an expert in Java and refactoring. \n\nThis command coordinates a multiphase workflow by executing individual commands in sequence.\n* Always complete a current phase first before reading description of the next phase.\n* Each phase must complete successfully before proceeding to the next phase.\n* When you start executing a new phase, update todo list with more details for the given phase.\n* Report complete but concise results of each phase and save it to phase<N>.md file (e.g. phase1.md)\n\nAt the beginning of the workflow get current date and time and create `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>` directory. All output files\nfor the given session and subagent sessions must be saved to this directory.\n* Pass the context on what the current directory is to each subagent. They must use this existing directory.\n\n!!IMPORTANT!! At the beginning of main session retrieve session ID using and save it to the output directory.\nIt is CRITICALLY important that you use relative path:\n`scripts/get-session-id.sh -o .output/<yyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/session-id.txt`.\n* On failures, retry it with different path variations and ALWAYS fail fast if you are not able to execute this command.\n\nPhase can be described as a slash command (`/<command-name>`). Do NOT use SlashCommand tool for those, read the command file instead (in `.claude/commands`)\n\n**CRITICAL VERBOSITY CONSTRAINTS:**\n- Be concise and factual - avoid verbose explanations\n- State findings clearly in bullet points, not prose\n- Skip background information and theory\n- Focus on actionable results and required outputs only\n- Do NOT create supplementary documentation files beyond the required files\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThe complete workflow consists of these phases:\n\n### Phase 1: `/fetch-repos <PR links>` - Repository Setup\nParse GitHub PR URLs, clone repositories, and set up PR branches for analysis.\n\nIn this phase you MUST save PR diff to the output directory.\nIn the code block below <default-branch> means the branch that is used in the repository by default. It is usually named `main` or `master`.\nIMPORTANT: save this file before continuing the workflow\n\n```bash\n# Save original PR diff for comparison\ncd <repo_directory>\ngit diff <default_branch> pr-<pr_number> --output=<output_dir>/pr-<pr_number>.diff\n```\n\n### Phase 2: `/extract-intent <pairs of repository-path:pr-branch-name>` - Intent Analysis  \nAnalyze PRs to extract both strategic (wide) and tactical (narrow) transformation intents.\nYou MUST NOT try to improve or add anything on top of what PR is doing. Always assume PR changes is the state the the user desires and work with PR changes only.\n\n### Phase 3: Recipe Mapping\nDiscover available OpenRewrite recipes and map extracted intents to appropriate recipes.\n**IMPORTANT**: Recipe name in YAML must be fully qualified (e.g., `com.example.PRRecipe123Option1`)\nALWAYS use specialized subagent to perform the mapping.\n\nAs a result two files must be created:\n* .output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-1-recipe.yaml\n* .output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-2-recipe.yaml\n\n### Phase 4: Recipe validation\nTest each recipe produced on the previous phase and make the final decision on what recipe is the final version.\n\nALWAYS use specialized subagents to perform the validation. You MUST let subagent know what options current task belongs to\n(e.g. `this recipe is called option 1`, `this recipe is called option 2`)\n\n### Phase 5: Recipe refinement\n\nBased on the results from 2 recipe alternative, combine the learnings to the final 3rd recipe.\nReuse the same openrewrite-expert subagent and point it to the resulting files to create a new recipe 3 (`option-3-recipe.yaml`)\n\nThen use a new openrewrite-recipe-validator subagent to validate the new recipe\n\n### Phase 6: Final decision\n\nBased on the results, choose the final recommended recipe and generate result artifacts.\nThis step is CRITICAL and must never be skipped. Even when results are not conclusive and none of the tested recipes\nprovide a definitive best output, one of the recipes must be chosen for the final recommendation.\n!Failure to complete this step constitutes the failure of the whole workflow!\n\n**Output Directory**: Create `result/` subdirectory in the output directory. Make sure it is created before any\nattempts to use it.\n\n**CRITICAL**: The following 3 files MUST be generated in EXACTLY the specified formats. These files are parsed by automated analysis scripts.\nFor the recommended recipe, you MUST only use yml and diff files saved to the output directory by subagents. If the files are not there,\nyou MUST NOT try to acquire them in any other way such as running gradle command, or create files that you assume are correct. In this case you\nmust clearly state that the task is failed and don't do anything else.\n\n#### Required Files\nAssuming you've already created output directory `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/` at the start of the workflow\n\n**1. `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/pr.diff`** - Original PR diff\nMUST be a result of `git diff` command execution\n```bash\ncd .workspace/<repo-name>\ngit diff <default-branch> <pr-branch> --output=.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/pr.diff\n```\n- Format: Unified diff format (output of `git diff`)\n- Purpose: Ground truth for comparison\n\n**2. `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/recommended-recipe.yaml`** - Final recipe YAML\n- Format: Valid OpenRewrite recipe YAML\n- Content: The SINGLE recommended recipe composition\n- Must be syntactically valid and executable\n\n**3. `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/recommended-recipe.diff`** - Recipe output from main branch\nMUST be copied from the subagent's validated recipe diff file (e.g., `option-1-recipe.diff`, `option-2-recipe.diff`, etc.)\n```bash\ncp .output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/<subagent-recipe-diff-file> .output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/recommended-recipe.diff\n```\n- Format: Unified diff format (from OpenRewrite execution)\n- Purpose: Result of OpenRewrite recipe execution for empirical validation\n- Source: Must be the exact file produced by the validator subagent that validated the chosen recipe\n- **CRITICAL**: Copy the subagent's resulting file directly. Do NOT generate this with git diff.\n\n## Input Handling\n\n* If GitHub PR URLs are provided as arguments, use those directly\n* If no arguments provided, interactively prompt the user to paste/enter a list of GitHub PR URLs\n* Accept multiple formats:\n  * Full PR URLs: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123\n  * Short format: owner/repo#123\n  * Mixed lists with whitespace, commas, or newlines as separators\n\n### Full Workflow\n```\n/rewrite-assist https://github.com/org/name/pull/123\n```\n\n### Interactive mode\n```\n/rewrite-assist\n> Claude: Please enter GitHub PR URLs\n> User: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n* If any phase fails, stop the workflow and report the failure\n* Provide clear guidance on how to resume from a specific phase\n* Log all errors and recovery steps in the reports\n\n## Success Criteria\n* All phases complete successfully\n* Actionable recommendations for recipe deployment or refinement\n* **CRITICAL**: Before reporting success, verify ALL expected files exist:\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/session-id.txt` - captured Session ID\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/intent-tree.md` - results of PR intents extraction\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-<N>-recipe.yaml` - generated OpenRewrite recipes\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-<N>-recipe.diff` - diffs from recipe validation\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-<N>-stats.json` - recipe effectiveness stats\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-<N>-creation-analysis.diff` - analysis by openrewrite expert who created the recipe\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/option-<N>-validation-analysis.diff` - analysis based on recipe validation results\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/pr-<N>.diff` - original PR diff\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/phase<N>.md` - reports for each phase\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/pr.diff` - PR diff, must be copied from `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>`\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/recommended-recipe.yaml` - recommended recipe, must be one of the options available in `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>`\n  - `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>/result/recommended-recipe.diff` - diff from the validation of the recommended recipe, must be copied from `.output/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-MM>`\n\nIf ANY file is missing, the workflow has FAILED. Do NOT report success.\n\nARGUMENTS: https://github.com/openrewrite-assist-testing-dataset/ecommerce-catalog/pull/2."}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"38189016-b6ad-40fa-8289-c47e3dea5c38","timestamp":"2025-11-28T21:48:56.441Z"}

OpenRewrite is an open-source automated refactoring ecosystem that uses **Lossless Semantic Trees (LST)** to perform safe, type-aware code transformations at scale. The framework originated at Netflix and has been adopted by major organizations for framework migrations, security patches, and code modernization.\n     6→\n     7→## Core OpenRewrite Architecture\n     8→\n     9→### Lossless Semantic Tree (LST) Foundation\n    10→\n    11→OpenRewrite's key innovation is the **LST**, which differentiates it from traditional AST-based tools. The LST is:\n    12→\n    13→- **Type-attributed**: Contains complete type information, even for external dependencies\n    14→- **Format-preserving**: Maintains all whitespace, comments, and formatting details\n    15→- **Semantic-rich**: Captures deeper semantic relationships beyond syntax\n    16→- **Lossless**: No information is lost during parsing and transformation\n    17→\n    18→**Key Advantage**: Unlike ASTs that lose formatting information, LSTs enable precise localized changes while preserving original code style and structure.\n    19→\n    20→### Language-Specific LST Types\n    21→\n    22→OpenRewrite supports multiple languages with specialized LST implementations:\n    23→\n    24→- **Java LST (J)**: Full Java language support with type attribution\n    25→- **XML LST**: For XML, Maven POM, and Spring configuration files\n    26→- **YAML LST**: For YAML configuration files\n    27→- **Properties LST**: For .properties files\n    28→- **JSON LST**: For JSON configuration files\n    29→- **Groovy LST**: For Gradle build files and Groovy scripts\n    30→- **Kotlin LST**: For Kotlin source files\n    31→\n    32→## Phase 1: Intent Extraction Best Practices\n    33→\n    34→### Understanding Refactoring Intent\n    35→\n    36→Intent extraction is about identifying the **what** and **why** of code changes. Common refactoring intents include:\n    37→\n    38→**1. Framework Migration Intent**\n    39→- **Indicators**: Version changes in dependencies, package renames, API deprecations\n    40→- **Examples**: \n    41→  - Spring Boot 2.7 → 3.0 (Jakarta namespace changes)\n    42→  - JUnit 4 → JUnit 5 (annotation and assertion changes)\n    43→  - Java EE → Jakarta EE (javax.* → jakarta.*)\n    44→\n    45→**2. Language Version Upgrade Intent**\n    46→- **Indicators**: Compiler version changes, new language feature adoption\n    47→- **Examples**:\n    48→  - Java 8 → Java 11 (var keyword, new APIs)\n    49→  - Java 11 → Java 17 (records, pattern matching)\n    50→  - Java 17 → Java 21 (virtual threads, pattern improvements)\n    51→\n    52→**3. Security Remediation Intent**\n    53→- **Indicators**: Vulnerable dependency updates, security pattern fixes\n    54→- **Examples**:\n    55→  - Log4j 2.x vulnerability patches\n    56→  - Hardcoded secrets removal\n    57→  - SQL injection prevention\n    58→\n    59→**4.

OpenRewrite is an open-source automated refactoring ecosystem that uses **Lossless Semantic Trees (LST)** to perform safe, type-aware code transformations at scale. The framework originated at Netflix and has been adopted by major organizations for framework migrations, security patches, and code modernization.\n\n## Core OpenRewrite Architecture\n\n### Lossless Semantic Tree (LST) Foundation\n\nOpenRewrite's key innovation is the **LST**, which differentiates it from traditional AST-based tools. The LST is:\n\n- **Type-attributed**: Contains complete type information, even for external dependencies\n- **Format-preserving**: Maintains all whitespace, comments, and formatting details\n- **Semantic-rich**: Captures deeper semantic relationships beyond syntax\n- **Lossless**: No information is lost during parsing and transformation\n\n**Key Advantage**: Unlike ASTs that lose formatting information, LSTs enable precise localized changes while preserving original code style and structure.\n\n### Language-Specific LST Types\n\nOpenRewrite supports multiple languages with specialized LST implementations:\n\n- **Java LST (J)**: Full Java language support with type attribution\n- **XML LST**: For XML, Maven POM, and Spring configuration files\n- **YAML LST**: For YAML configuration files\n- **Properties LST**: For .properties files\n- **JSON LST**: For JSON configuration files\n- **Groovy LST**: For Gradle build files and Groovy scripts\n- **Kotlin LST**: For Kotlin source files\n\n## Phase 1: Intent Extraction Best Practices\n\n### Understanding Refactoring Intent\n\nIntent extraction is about identifying the **what** and **why** of code changes. Common refactoring intents include:\n\n**1. Framework Migration Intent**\n- **Indicators**: Version changes in dependencies, package renames, API deprecations\n- **Examples**: \n  - Spring Boot 2.7 → 3.0 (Jakarta namespace changes)\n  - JUnit 4 → JUnit 5 (annotation and assertion changes)\n  - Java EE → Jakarta EE (javax.* → jakarta.*)\n\n**2. Language Version Upgrade Intent**\n- **Indicators**: Compiler version changes, new language feature adoption\n- **Examples**:\n  - Java 8 → Java 11 (var keyword, new APIs)\n  - Java 11 → Java 17 (records, pattern matching)\n  - Java 17 → Java 21 (virtual threads, pattern improvements)\n\n**3. Security Remediation Intent**\n- **Indicators**: Vulnerable dependency updates, security pattern fixes\n- **Examples**:\n  - Log4j 2.x vulnerability patches\n  - Hardcoded secrets removal\n  - SQL injection prevention\n\n**4. Code Quality Improvement Intent**\n- **Indicators**: Static analysis fixes, code simplification patterns\n- **Examples**:\n  - Null safety improvements\n  - Dead code removal\n  - Method extraction for readability\n\n### Intent Extraction Rules of Thumb\n\n**Rule 1: Look for Patterns, Not Individual Changes**\n- Single file changes rarely indicate systematic refactoring\n- Multiple similar changes suggest automated transformation opportunity\n- Consistent patterns across files indicate recipe potential\n\n**Rule 2: Identify Scope and Granularity**\n- **Project-wide**: Dependency updates, framework migrations\n- **Package-level**: API reorganization, module restructuring\n- **Class-level**: Design pattern implementation, inheritance changes\n- **Method-level**: API usage updates, parameter modifications\n\n**Rule 3: Recognize Common Transformation Types**\n- **Type Changes**: Class renames, package migrations\n- **Method Signature Changes**: Parameter additions/removals, return type changes\n- **Annotation Updates**: Framework-specific annotation migrations\n- **Configuration Changes**: Property renames, format migrations\n\n## Phase 2: Visitor Patterns Deep Dive\n\n### Core Visitor Types and Use Cases\n\n#### 1. JavaVisitor - The Base Visitor\n\n**When to use**: When you need full control over the visiting process\n```java\npublic class CustomJavaVisitor extends JavaVisitor<ExecutionContext> {\n    @Override\n    public J visitCompilationUnit(J.CompilationUnit cu, ExecutionContext ctx) {\n        // Visit entire compilation unit\n        return super.visitCompilationUnit(cu, ctx);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Best for**:\n- Complex multi-element transformations\n- Custom traversal logic\n- Performance-critical operations\n\n#### 2. JavaIsoVisitor - The Type-Preserving Visitor\n\n**When to use**: Most common choice for safe transformations\n```java\npublic class TypeSafeVisitor extends JavaIsoVisitor<ExecutionContext> {\n    @Override\n    public J.MethodInvocation visitMethodInvocation(J.MethodInvocation method, ExecutionContext ctx) {\n        // Type is preserved - returns J.MethodInvocation\n        return super.visitMethodInvocation(method, ctx);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Best for**:\n- Method refactoring\n- Type changes\n- Import modifications\n- Most general-purpose transformations\n\n#### 3. JavaTemplate - The Pattern-Based Transformation\n\n**When to use**: For inserting or replacing code with complex structures\n```java\nJavaTemplate template = JavaTemplate.builder(\"#{any(java.lang.String)}.isEmpty()\")\n    .imports(\"java.lang.String\")\n    .build();\n```\n\n**Best for**:\n- Adding new code blocks\n- Complex expression replacements\n- Method body transformations\n- Maintaining proper formatting\n\n### Language-Specific Visitors\n\n#### XML Visitors\n```java\npublic class XmlIsoVisitor<P> extends XmlVisitor<P> {\n    @Override\n    public Xml.Tag visitTag(Xml.Tag tag, P p) {\n        // Transform XML elements\n        return super.visitTag(tag, p);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Maven POM transformations\n- Spring XML configuration updates\n- General XML refactoring\n\n#### YAML Visitors\n```java\npublic class YamlIsoVisitor<P> extends YamlVisitor<P> {\n    @Override\n    public Yaml.Mapping.Entry visitMappingEntry(Yaml.Mapping.Entry entry, P p) {\n        // Transform YAML key-value pairs\n        return super.visitMappingEntry(entry, p);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Application configuration updates\n- CI/CD pipeline modifications\n- Kubernetes manifest transformations\n\n#### Properties Visitors\n```java\npublic class PropertiesVisitor<P> extends TreeVisitor<Properties, P> {\n    @Override\n    public Properties.Entry visitEntry(Properties.Entry entry, P p) {\n        // Transform property entries\n        return super.visitEntry(entry, p);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Application property migrations\n- Configuration key renames\n- Value standardization\n\n#### Groovy/Gradle Visitors\n```java\npublic class GroovyIsoVisitor<P> extends GroovyVisitor<P> {\n    @Override\n    public G.CompilationUnit visitCompilationUnit(G.CompilationUnit cu, P p) {\n        // Transform Gradle build scripts\n        return super.visitCompilationUnit(cu, p);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Gradle dependency updates\n- Build configuration modernization\n- Plugin migrations\n\n### Specialized Visitor Patterns\n\n#### ScanningRecipe - Two-Phase Transformation\n**When to use**: When you need to analyze the entire codebase before making changes\n\n**Phase 1 - Scanning**:\n- Collect information across all files\n- Build dependency graphs\n- Identify transformation candidates\n\n**Phase 2 - Transformation**:\n- Apply changes based on collected data\n- Ensure consistency across files\n- Handle cross-file dependencies\n\n**Best for**:\n- Unused code removal\n- Dependency analysis\n- Cross-file refactoring\n- Impact analysis\n\n#### Preconditions - Conditional Visitors\n**When to use**: To limit recipe application to specific contexts\n\nTypes of preconditions:\n- **File-based**: Only apply to certain file types or paths\n- **Content-based**: Only apply when specific patterns exist\n- **Dependency-based**: Only apply when certain libraries are present\n\n## Phase 3: Recipe Selection Strategy\n\n### Understanding Recipe Granularity\n\n#### Broad/General Recipes\nThese recipes perform comprehensive transformations across multiple aspects:\n\n**Example: UpgradeSpringBoot_3_0**\n- Updates all Spring Boot dependencies\n- Migrates javax to jakarta namespaces  \n- Updates configuration properties\n- Adapts deprecated APIs\n- Modifies build configurations\n\n**When to use broad recipes**:\n- Starting a major migration\n- Ensuring comprehensive coverage\n- When all changes are desired\n- Team lacks detailed knowledge\n\n#### Narrow/Specific Recipes\nThese recipes target precise transformations:\n\n**Example: ChangeGradleJavaLanguageVersion**\n- Only modifies `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility`\n- Leaves other build configurations untouched\n- Very predictable outcome\n\n**When to use specific recipes**:\n- Surgical precision needed\n- Gradual migration approach\n- Risk mitigation important\n- Custom requirements exist\n\n### Recipe Mapping Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Start with Recipe Discovery\n\n**Search strategies**:\n- Use recipe catalog websites\n- Search by framework name + version\n- Look for recipe tags matching your intent\n- Check recipe descriptions for coverage\n\n**Example discovery patterns**:\n- \"spring boot 3\" → finds Spring Boot migration recipes\n- \"junit 5\" → finds JUnit migration recipes  \n- \"java 17\" → finds Java version upgrade recipes\n- \"log4j\" → finds security remediation recipes\n\n#### 2. Evaluate Recipe Fit\n\n**Assessment criteria**:\n- **Coverage**: Does it handle all your patterns?\n- **Side effects**: What else does it change?\n- **Dependencies**: Required libraries or versions?\n- **Configurability**: Can you customize behavior?\n\n**Red flags**:\n- Recipe description is vague\n- No test coverage shown\n- Handles too many unrelated concerns\n- No configuration options\n\n#### 3. Recipe Composition Strategy\n\n**Layering approach**:\n1. **Foundation layer**: Broad migration recipes\n2. **Refinement layer**: Specific adjustments\n3. **Cleanup layer**: Formatting and imports\n4. **Validation layer**: Static analysis\n\n**Example composition for Java 8 → Java 21**:\n```yaml\nrecipeList:\n  # Foundation: Core language migration\n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.Java8toJava11\n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.Java11toJava17  \n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.Java17toJava21\n  \n  # Refinement: Specific feature adoption\n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UseTextBlocks\n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UseRecords\n  \n  # Cleanup: Code organization\n  - org.openrewrite.java.OrderImports\n  - org.openrewrite.java.RemoveUnusedImports\n  \n  # Validation: Quality checks\n  - org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CommonStaticAnalysis\n```\n\n### Recipe Selection Decision Tree\n\n**For Framework Migrations:**\n1. Check for official framework migration recipe\n2. If exists → use it as foundation\n3. If not → compose from specific recipes\n4. Add framework-specific cleanup recipes\n5. Include static analysis for validation\n\n**For Security Remediations:**\n1. Look for CVE-specific recipes first\n2. Check security-focused recipe modules\n3. Consider dependency upgrade recipes\n4. Add security scanning recipes\n5. Include compliance validation\n\n**For Code Quality:**\n1. Start with static analysis recipe bundles\n2. Add specific pattern fixes\n3. Include formatting standardization\n4. Consider readability improvements\n5. Add metric validation\n\n## Phase 4: Recipe Type Categories\n\n### 1. Search Recipes (Non-modifying)\n**Purpose**: Find code patterns without changing them\n\n**Common search recipes**:\n- `FindTypes`: Locate usage of specific classes\n- `FindMethods`: Find method invocations\n- `FindAnnotations`: Locate annotated elements\n- `FindText`: Search for text patterns\n\n**Use cases**:\n- Impact analysis before refactoring\n- Compliance checking\n- Dependency analysis\n- Technical debt assessment\n\n### 2. Refactoring Recipes (Code transformation)\n**Purpose**: Transform code structure while preserving behavior\n\n**Categories**:\n- **Type refactoring**: Class renames, package moves\n- **Method refactoring**: Signature changes, extractions\n- **Field refactoring**: Encapsulation, type changes\n- **Pattern refactoring**: Design pattern implementation\n\n### 3. Migration Recipes (Framework/version upgrades)\n**Purpose**: Adapt code to new framework versions or APIs\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Often composite recipes\n- Include multiple transformation types\n- Handle breaking changes\n- Update configurations\n\n### 4. Static Analysis Recipes (Code quality)\n**Purpose**: Improve code quality and maintainability\n\n**Common improvements**:\n- Null safety enhancements\n- Resource leak prevention\n- Code simplification\n- Performance optimizations\n\n### 5. Security Recipes (Vulnerability remediation)\n**Purpose**: Fix security vulnerabilities and prevent issues\n\n**Focus areas**:\n- Dependency vulnerabilities\n- Injection prevention\n- Cryptography updates\n- Secret management\n\n### 6. Formatting Recipes (Code style)\n**Purpose**: Standardize code formatting and organization\n\n**Scope**:\n- Import organization\n- Whitespace normalization\n- Naming conventions\n- Comment formatting\n\n## Phase 5: Multi-File Recipe Patterns\n\n### Handling Different File Types\n\n#### Java + Maven POM Coordination\n```yaml\nrecipeList:\n  # Update Java code\n  - org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_0\n  \n  # Update Maven configuration\n  - org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradeParentVersion:\n      groupId: org.springframework.boot\n      artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent\n      newVersion: 3.0.x\n      \n  # Update properties\n  - org.openrewrite.maven.ChangePropertyValue:\n      key: java.version\n      newValue: 17\n```\n\n#### Java + Gradle Build Coordination\n```yaml\nrecipeList:\n  # Update Java code\n  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.JavaxMigrationToJakarta\n  \n  # Update Gradle configuration  \n  - org.openrewrite.gradle.UpdateGradleWrapper:\n      version: 8.x\n      \n  - org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.UpgradePluginVersion:\n      pluginId: org.springframework.boot\n      newVersion: 3.0.x\n```\n\n#### Application Code + Configuration Files\n```yaml\nrecipeList:\n  # Update Java annotations\n  - org.openrewrite.java.spring.ChangeSpringPropertyKey:\n      oldPropertyKey: spring.profiles\n      newPropertyKey: spring.config.activate.on-profile\n      \n  # Update YAML configuration\n  - org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangePropertyKey:\n      oldPropertyKey: spring.profiles\n      newPropertyKey: spring.config.activate.on-profile\n      \n  # Update properties files\n  - org.openrewrite.properties.ChangePropertyKey:\n      oldPropertyKey: spring.profiles  \n      newPropertyKey: spring.config.activate.on-profile\n```\n\n## Phase 6: Testing Strategies by Recipe Type\n\n### Testing Search Recipes\n- Verify correct pattern identification\n- Test edge cases and variations\n- Ensure no false positives\n- Validate performance on large codebases\n\n### Testing Refactoring Recipes\n- Confirm behavior preservation\n- Test with different code styles\n- Verify type safety maintained\n- Check compilation success\n\n### Testing Migration Recipes\n- Test against multiple source versions\n- Verify all deprecations handled\n- Check backward compatibility needs\n- Validate with real project structures\n\n### Testing Static Analysis Recipes\n- Ensure issues correctly identified\n- Verify fixes don't break code\n- Test idempotency\n- Check for over-correction\n\n## Implementation Best Practices\n\n### 1. Recipe Development Workflow\n\n**Step 1: Define Clear Intent**\n- What specific transformation is needed?\n- What patterns should be matched?\n- What should be excluded?\n- What are the edge cases?\n\n**Step 2: Choose Appropriate Visitor**\n- JavaIsoVisitor for most Java transformations\n- ScanningRecipe for cross-file analysis\n- Language-specific visitors for other files\n- JavaTemplate for complex replacements\n\n**Step 3: Implement Incrementally**\n- Start with simple cases\n- Add complexity gradually\n- Test each increment\n- Handle edge cases last\n\n**Step 4: Optimize for Performance**\n- Minimize tree traversals\n- Use efficient matching patterns\n- Cache expensive computations\n- Return early when possible\n\n### 2. Error Handling Philosophy\n\n**Do No Harm Principle**:\n- If unsure, don't transform\n- Preserve original code on errors\n- Log warnings for skipped transformations\n- Never produce invalid code\n\n**Graceful Degradation**:\n- Handle missing dependencies\n- Work with partial type information\n- Skip unsupported patterns\n- Continue with other files\n\n### 3. Recipe Composition Guidelines\n\n**Ordering Matters**:\n1. Structural changes first (renames, moves)\n2. API updates second\n3. Code cleanup third\n4. Formatting last\n\n**Avoid Conflicts**:\n- Don't combine overlapping transformations\n- Separate analysis from modification\n- Use preconditions to prevent conflicts\n- Test composed recipes thoroughly\n\n### 4. Documentation Standards\n\n**Essential Documentation**:\n- Clear display name and description\n- Concrete before/after examples\n- Preconditions and limitations\n- Configuration options explained\n- Tags for discoverability\n\n**Example Documentation Pattern**:\n```yaml\ndisplayName: Migrate to JUnit 5\ndescription: |\n  Migrates JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5, including:\n  - Annotation changes (@Test, @Before, @After)\n  - Assertion method updates\n  - Exception testing patterns\n  - Parameterized test conversion\ntags:\n  - testing\n  - junit\n  - migration\nestimatedEffortPerOccurrence: PT5M\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization Guidelines\n\n### Memory Management\n- Use `ListUtils.map()` instead of streams for LST operations\n- Return the same LST instance when no changes made\n- Avoid creating unnecessary objects\n- Use JavaTemplate for complex constructions\n\n### Execution Efficiency\n- Design single-pass visitors when possible\n- Use preconditions to skip irrelevant files\n- Implement early termination conditions\n- Cache regex patterns and matchers\n\n### Scalability Considerations\n- Test with large codebases\n- Monitor memory usage\n- Optimize for common cases\n- Consider parallel execution impacts\n\n## Summary: Key Success Factors\n\n1. **Clear Intent**: Understand exactly what needs transformation\n2. **Right Tool**: Choose appropriate visitor and recipe type\n3. **Incremental Approach**: Build complexity gradually\n4. **Thorough Testing**: Cover edge cases and variations\n5. **Good Documentation**: Enable easy discovery and usage\n6. **Performance Focus**: Optimize for large-scale execution\n7. **Error Resilience**: Handle unexpected cases gracefully\n\nThis guide provides comprehensive coverage of OpenRewrite concepts, patterns, and best practices for implementing high-quality automated refactoring solutions.","numLines":606,"startLine":1,"totalLines":606}}}

Gradle Build Configuration (High Confidence)\n- **Pattern**: Replace sourceCompatibility/targetCompatibility with Java toolchain\n- **Changes**:\n  - Remove `sourceCompatibility = '17'`\n  - Remove `targetCompatibility = '17'`\n  - Add java toolchain block with `languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)`\n  - Upgrade Gradle wrapper from 8.1 to 8.5\n\n### 2. Docker Infrastructure (High Confidence)\n- **Pattern**: Update Eclipse Temurin base images from version 17 to 21\n- **Changes**:\n  - Builder stage: `eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine` → `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine`\n  - Runtime stage: `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine` → `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine`\n\n### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (High Confidence)\n- **Pattern**: Update GitHub Actions Java setup from version 17 to 21\n- **Changes**:\n  - Step name: \"Set up JDK 17\" → \"Set up JDK 21\"\n  - Parameter: `java-version: '17'` → `java-version: '21'`\n\n### 4.
