An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. Defaults to the latest release available from services.gradle.org if not specified. | `7.x` |\\n| `String` | distribution | *Optional*. The distribution of Gradle to use. \\\"bin\\\" includes Gradle binaries. \\\"all\\\" includes Gradle binaries, source code, and documentation. Defaults to \\\"bin\\\". Valid options: `bin`, `all` |  |\\n| `Boolean` | addIfMissing | *Optional*. Add a Gradle wrapper, if it's missing. Defaults to `true`. |  |\\n                    | `String` | wrapperUri | *Optional*. The URI of the Gradle wrapper distribution.\\nSpecifies a custom location from which to download the Gradle wrapper scripts (gradlew, gradlew.bat, etc.). This is useful for setting up the Gradle wrapper without relying on Gradle's official distribution services.\\n\\nWhen this option is set, the version and distribution fields must not be specified \\u2014 only one source of truth is allowed. The URI should point to a valid and reachable Gradle wrapper distribution (typically a .zip archive containing the wrapper files).\\nThis is particularly helpful in environments where access to Gradle's central services is restricted or where custom Gradle wrapper setups are required.\\nIf the URI is inaccessible, the recipe will leave the existing wrapper files in the repository unchanged, as they are generally compatible with various Gradle versions. | `https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip` |\\n| `String` | distributionChecksum | *Optional*. The SHA-256 checksum of the Gradle distribution. If specified, the recipe will add the checksum along with the custom distribution URL. | `29e49b10984e585d8118b7d0bc452f944e386458df27371b49b4ac1dec4b7fda` |\\n\\n\\n## Used by\\n\\nThis recipe is used as part of the following composite recipes:\\n\\n* [Migrate from Micronaut 3.x to 4.x](/recipes/java/micronaut/micronaut3to4migration.md)\\n* [Migrate from Spring Boot 1.x to 2.0](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_0.md)\\n* [Migrate to Gradle 5 from Gradle 4](/recipes/gradle/migratetogradle5.md)\\n* [Migrate to Gradle 6 from Gradle 5](/recipes/gradle/migratetogradle6.md)\\n* [Migrate to Gradle 7 from Gradle 6](/recipes/gradle/migratetogradle7.md)\\n* [Migrate to Gradle 8 from Gradle 7](/recipes/gradle/migratetogradle8.md)\\n* [Migrate to Gradle 9 from Gradle 8](/recipes/gradle/migratetogradle9.md)\\n* [Migrate to Spring Boot 2.1](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_1.md)\\n* [Migrate to Spring Boot 2.2](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_2.md)\\n* [Migrate to Spring Boot 2.3](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_3.md)\\n* [Migrate to Spring Boot 3.0](/recipes/java/spring/boot3/upgradespringboot_3_0.md)\\n* [Upgrade Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version](/recipes/android/upgradeandroidgradlepluginversion.md)\\n* [Upgrade plugins to Java 17 compatible versions](/recipes/java/migrate/upgradepluginsforjava17.md)\\n* [Upgrade plugins to Java 21 compatible versions](/recipes/java/migrate/upgradepluginsforjava21.md)\\n* [Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_5.md)\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n###### Parameters\\n| Parameter | Value |\\n| -- | -- |\\n|version|`7.4.2`|\\n|distribution|`null`|\\n|addIfMissing|`null`|\\n|wrapperUri|`null`|\\n|distributionChecksum|`null`|\\n\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\\\"beforeAfter\\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\\"properties\\\" label=\\\"properties\\\">\\n\\n\\n###### Before\\n```properties\\ndistributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\ndistributionPath=wrapper/dists\\ndistributionUrl=https\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4-bin.zip\\nzipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\nzipStorePath=wrapper/dists\\n```\\n\\n###### After\\n```properties\\ndistributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\ndistributionPath=wrapper/dists\\ndistributionUrl=https\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4.2-bin.zip\\nzipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\nzipStorePath=wrapper/dists\\ndistributionSha256Sum=29e49b10984e585d8118b7d0bc452f944e386458df27371b49b4ac1dec4b7fda\\n```\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n<TabItem value=\\\"diff\\\" label=\\\"Diff\\\" >\\n\\n```diff\\n@@ -3,1 +3,1 @@\\ndistributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\ndistributionPath=wrapper/dists\\n-distributionUrl=https\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4-bin.zip\\n+distributionUrl=https\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4.2-bin.zip\\nzipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\n@@ -6,0 +6,1 @@\\nzipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME\\nzipStorePath=wrapper/dists\\n+distributionSha256Sum=29e49b10984e585d8118b7d0bc452f944e386458df27371b49b4ac1dec4b7fda\\n\\n```\\n</TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThis recipe has no required configuration parameters and comes from a rewrite core library.

For example: `com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample`.\\nHere's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:\\n```yaml title=\\\"rewrite.yml\\\"\\n---\\ntype: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe\\nname: com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample\\ndisplayName: Change YAML property example\\nrecipeList:\\n  - org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangePropertyValue:\\n      propertyKey: management.metrics.binders.*.enabled\\n      newValue: newValue\\n      oldValue: oldValue\\n      filePattern: .github/workflows/*.yml\\n```\\n\\nNow that `com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:\\n<Tabs groupId=\\\"projectType\\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\\"gradle\\\" label=\\\"Gradle\\\">\\n\\n1.

Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample`.\\nHere's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:\\n```yaml title=\\\"rewrite.yml\\\"\\n---\\ntype: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe\\nname: com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample\\ndisplayName: Find and replace example\\nrecipeList:\\n  - org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace:\\n      find: blacklist\\n      replace: denylist\\n      filePattern: '**/*.java'\\n```\\n\\nNow that `com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:\\n<Tabs groupId=\\\"projectType\\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\\"gradle\\\" label=\\\"Gradle\\\">\\n\\n1.

Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample`.\\nHere's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:\\n```yaml title=\\\"rewrite.yml\\\"\\n---\\ntype: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe\\nname: com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample\\ndisplayName: Find and replace example\\nrecipeList:\\n  - org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace:\\n      find: blacklist\\n      replace: denylist\\n      filePattern: '**/*.java'\\n```\\n\\nNow that `com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:\\n<Tabs groupId=\\\"projectType\\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\\"gradle\\\" label=\\\"Gradle\\\">\\n\\n1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:\\n```groovy title=\\\"build.gradle\\\"\\nplugins {\\n    id(\\\"org.openrewrite.rewrite\\\") version(\\\"latest.release\\\")\\n}\\n\\nrewrite {\\n    activeRecipe(\\\"com.yourorg.FindAndReplaceExample\\\")\\n    setExportDatatables(true)\\n}\\n\\nrepositories {\\n    mavenCentral()\\n}\\n```\\n2.

Gradle Java Version Configuration\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UpgradeJavaVersion` (version: 21)\n**Coverage**:\n- Replaces `sourceCompatibility = '17'` with toolchain configuration\n- Replaces `targetCompatibility = '17'` with toolchain configuration\n- Adds `java.toolchain.languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)`\n**Semantic Approach**: Uses Gradle LST to understand build file structure and properly configure Java toolchain\n\n### 2. Gradle Wrapper Update\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.gradle.UpdateGradleWrapper` (version: 8.5)\n**Coverage**: Updates Gradle wrapper from 8.1 to 8.5\n**Semantic Approach**: Modifies gradle-wrapper.properties understanding the properties file format\n\n### 3. GitHub Actions Java Version\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.github.SetupJavaUpgradeJavaVersion` (minimumJavaMajorVersion: 21)\n**Coverage**:\n- Updates `java-version: '17'` to `java-version: '21'` in setup-java action\n**Semantic Approach**: Understands YAML structure and GitHub Actions workflow schema to modify the correct property\n\n### 4. GitHub Actions Step Name\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace`\n**Coverage**: Changes step name from \"Set up JDK 17\" to \"Set up JDK 21\"\n**Why Text-based**:\n- Step names are free-form strings without semantic meaning\n- No semantic recipe exists for renaming workflow step names\n- YAML value replacement would be overly complex for simple string change\n**Parameters**:\n- find: \"Set up JDK 17\"\n- replace: \"Set up JDK 21\"\n- filePattern: \".github/workflows/*.yml\"\n\n### 5. Dockerfile Builder Stage Base Image\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace`\n**Coverage**: Changes FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine to eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine\n**Why Text-based**:\n- No semantic Dockerfile recipe found for base image updates\n- Docker base images are string literals in FROM statements\n- Text replacement is precise and safe for this pattern\n**Parameters**:\n- find: \"eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine\"\n- replace: \"eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine\"\n- filePattern: \"**/Dockerfile\"\n\n### 6.

README.md Documentation Updates\n**Recipe**: `org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace`\n**Coverage**: Updates \"Java 17\" to \"Java 21\" in both Technology Stack and Prerequisites sections\n**Why Text-based**:\n- Documentation is plain text/markdown without semantic structure\n- No semantic recipe for markdown content updates\n- Simple string replacement appropriate for documentation\n**Parameters**:\n- find: \"Java 17\"\n- replace: \"Java 21\"\n- filePattern: \"**/README.md\"\n\n## Gap Analysis\n\n**Complete Coverage**: All transformations from the intent tree are covered\n\n**No Gaps Identified**:\n1. Gradle configuration ✓ - Covered by UpgradeJavaVersion\n2. Gradle wrapper ✓ - Covered by UpdateGradleWrapper\n3. GitHub Actions java-version ✓ - Covered by SetupJavaUpgradeJavaVersion\n4. GitHub Actions step name ✓ - Covered by text replacement (no semantic alternative)\n5. Dockerfile base images ✓ - Covered by text replacement (no semantic alternative)\n6. README documentation ✓ - Covered by text replacement (appropriate for docs)\n\n## Recipe Selection Rationale\n\n**Semantic Recipes (Priority)**:\n1. `UpgradeJavaVersion` - Handles complex Gradle build file transformations correctly\n2. `UpdateGradleWrapper` - Manages wrapper properties with checksums\n3. `SetupJavaUpgradeJavaVersion` - Understands GitHub Actions YAML structure\n\n**Text-based Recipes (When Necessary)**:\n4-7. `FindAndReplace` - Used only where no semantic alternative exists:\n   - GitHub Actions step names (free-form strings)\n   - Dockerfile FROM statements (no Dockerfile semantic recipes available)\n   - README.md content (markdown documentation)\n\n## Composition Strategy\n\n**Sequential Execution**:\n1. Gradle changes first (build foundation)\n2. GitHub Actions updates (CI/CD)\n3. Docker image updates (deployment)\n4. Documentation updates last (non-functional)\n\n**Recipe Ordering**:\n- Semantic recipes execute before text-based to preserve LST where possible\n- Text recipes target specific file patterns to avoid unintended changes\n- No conflicts between recipes (different files or non-overlapping changes)\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Precise control over each transformation\n- Easy to understand what each recipe does\n- Can be selectively applied or removed\n- Minimal risk of unintended changes\n\n**Disadvantages**:\n- More verbose than broad recipes\n- Multiple text-based recipes for simple replacements\n- May need updates if file patterns change\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n1. Verify Gradle build still works after toolchain migration\n2. Test GitHub Actions workflow executes successfully\n3. Verify Docker images build and run correctly\n4. Review README.md for any missed version references\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5399,"cache_read_input_tokens":68104,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5399,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2367,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVb2bsBM7BcBeUrC7d5C5","type":"assistant","uuid":"4cb038fc-e8e6-47e2-80d3-8cb3c6f5dcf8","timestamp":"2025-11-28T21:52:41.792Z"}

README documentation ✓ - Covered by text replacement (appropriate for docs)\n\n## Recipe Selection Rationale\n\n**Semantic Recipes (Priority)**:\n1. `UpgradeJavaVersion` - Handles complex Gradle build file transformations correctly\n2. `UpdateGradleWrapper` - Manages wrapper properties with checksums\n3. `SetupJavaUpgradeJavaVersion` - Understands GitHub Actions YAML structure\n\n**Text-based Recipes (When Necessary)**:\n4-7. `FindAndReplace` - Used only where no semantic alternative exists:\n   - GitHub Actions step names (free-form strings)\n   - Dockerfile FROM statements (no Dockerfile semantic recipes available)\n   - README.md content (markdown documentation)\n\n## Composition Strategy\n\n**Sequential Execution**:\n1. Gradle changes first (build foundation)\n2. GitHub Actions updates (CI/CD)\n3. Docker image updates (deployment)\n4. Documentation updates last (non-functional)\n\n**Recipe Ordering**:\n- Semantic recipes execute before text-based to preserve LST where possible\n- Text recipes target specific file patterns to avoid unintended changes\n- No conflicts between recipes (different files or non-overlapping changes)\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Precise control over each transformation\n- Easy to understand what each recipe does\n- Can be selectively applied or removed\n- Minimal risk of unintended changes\n\n**Disadvantages**:\n- More verbose than broad recipes\n- Multiple text-based recipes for simple replacements\n- May need updates if file patterns change\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n1. Verify Gradle build still works after toolchain migration\n2. Test GitHub Actions workflow executes successfully\n3. Verify Docker images build and run correctly\n4. Review README.md for any missed version references\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
