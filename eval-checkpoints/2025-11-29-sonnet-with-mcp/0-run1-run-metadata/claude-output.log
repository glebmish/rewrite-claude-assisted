Excellent! All phases completed successfully. Let me create a final summary.

## Workflow Summary

**Session ID**: Captured in `.output/2025-11-28-21-49/session-id.txt`

### Phase 1: Repository Setup ✓
- Cloned ecommerce-catalog repository
- Fetched PR #2 branch
- Saved PR diff

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis ✓
- **Strategic Intent**: Upgrade Java 17 to Java 21
- **Tactical Intents**: Gradle toolchain migration, Docker images, GitHub Actions, documentation
- Identified 5 transformation categories across 4 file types

### Phase 3: Recipe Mapping ✓
Created 2 recipe options:
- **Option 1**: Broad approach using `UpgradeToJava21` migration recipe
- **Option 2**: Narrow approach with targeted semantic recipes

### Phase 4: Recipe Validation ✓
Validation results:
- **Option 1**: F1=0.50, Precision=0.40, Recall=0.67 (many over-applications)
- **Option 2**: F1=0.70, Precision=0.74, Recall=0.67 (better precision)

### Phase 5: Recipe Refinement ✓
- **Option 3**: Combined best practices from both options
- Fixed critical Java toolchain API migration gap
- **Results**: F1=0.81, Precision=0.73, Recall=0.90 (best overall)

### Phase 6: Final Decision ✓
**Recommended Recipe**: Option 3 (`com.example.PRRecipe2Option3`)

**Rationale**:
- Highest F1 score (0.81 vs 0.70 and 0.50)
- Best recall (90% coverage vs 67%)
- Good precision (73%)
- Successfully migrates to Java toolchain API
- Minimal over-application

**Result files created**:
- ✓ `result/pr.diff` - Original PR diff
- ✓ `result/recommended-recipe.yaml` - Option 3 recipe
- ✓ `result/recommended-recipe.diff` - Recipe execution output

All required files verified and present in `.output/2025-11-28-21-49/`
