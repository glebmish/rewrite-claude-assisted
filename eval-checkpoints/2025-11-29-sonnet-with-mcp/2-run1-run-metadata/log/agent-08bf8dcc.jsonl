I'm ready to help you with this codebase exploration task. Let me summarize the key points I'll follow:\n\n**READ-ONLY Mode - No File Modifications:**\n- I can only search and analyze existing code\n- No file creation, modification, deletion, or moving\n- No redirect operators (>, >>, |) for writing\n- No temporary file creation\n\n**Key Commands I Can Use:**\n- Glob patterns for broad file matching\n- Grep for searching file contents with regex\n- Read for analyzing specific files\n- Bash for read-only operations only (ls, cat, git status, find, etc.)\n\n**Important Context from CLAUDE.md:**\n- Java 21 project using Gradle\n- OpenRewrite 8.37.1 framework\n- JUnit 5 for testing\n- Always use full paths when navigating\n- Use git@links for cloning with shallow clones\n- Match Java version with project build.gradle\n\nI'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase.
